The Awkward Quest for a Funky Natural Red Wine <br> By Adam Aslan

An awkward question is posed, “hey...there...I'm looking for a ...natural wine...something funky...that isn’t going to cost over twenty five dollars?” 
<br><br>

If you are like me, then your normal speaking voice is ridden with pauses so as to humbly point out a lack of certainty. When it comes to the trendy movement of natural wines, one could say the whole movement should be speaking in such a tone. A movement that is clearly going to gain steam in 2019, natural wines do not come with a certification one has to pay for like a wine that is certified organic or biodynamic for example. Thus, the definition of “natural” remains shrouded in mystery and very much open to interpretation.
<br><br>
While the question of what makes a wine natural is clearly an interesting one, another great question is: why is everybody freaking out over natural wines? There are several good answers to that question. You could answer that question by mentioning all the nods to minimalism that comes with natural wine like the lack of and or minimal use of sulfites, lack of advanced technology, or lack of filtration. Another way you could answer that question would be to mention how natural wine uses old school techniques that have been tried and true for thousands of years of wine making history. Oh and let us not forget about all the cool labels they come with, boutique distributors, specialized stores, and  fancy restaurants all dedicated to natural wine. However, none of these are the best reason to freak out about natural wine in my humble opinion.

3 Low Cost High Value Red Wines <br>By Adam Aslan 

 
If you are looking for wine that is low in cost and high in value, we have found 3 that fit the description perfectly.
<br><br> 
1.  Santa Rita’s 120 Carménère <br> <img src="120.jpg" width="35% height="35% ">  <br>
While Carménère is not one of the most popular types of wine out there it certainly a solid bodied red that is the pride of Chile. What makes Santa Rita’s Carménère stand out from the crowd is its uniquely pleasant mouthfeel characterized by a deep fruitiness. Is it sweet? Yes, but still elegant and with a strong nose full of red fruit and crisp spices. <br><br>Especially recommended for the budding red wine enthusiast looking to diversify their palate, the 120 Carménère evokes nostalgia for Chilean culture through its taste as well as the ‘120’ series name, which is titled after Doña Paula Jaraquemada who hid 120 Chilean revolutionaries during their war for independence from Spain.
