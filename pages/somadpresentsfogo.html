    Much was done to advocate for the rights of BIPOC over the summer and steps
    have been made by some art institutions to be more inclusive, but still
    “FOGO!” an exhibition featuring Latinx artists in support of APIB
    (Brazilian's Indigenous People Articulation) stands out amongst the rest.
    The show is powerful and pays beautiful homage to an indigenous aesthetic
    that is simultaneously historically rich and contemporary.

      Anytime a group show features 19 artists, one may be a bit scared as to the
      amplified variety of aesthetics and varying quality of the art, but SoMad
      did an impeccable job of curation, which makes the viewing experience both
      pleasant and inspiring.

      Here is more from the press release:
      "SoMad is thrilled to present FOGO!. The exhibition will take place in the
      physical space of the gallery open to the public from October 12th to
      November 12th, 2020. Tickets can be obtained on EventBrite for the
      physically distanced Opening Reception on Indigenous People’s Day (formally
      known as Columbus Day,) October 12, 2020, from 3:00–9:00pm and also for
      viewing throughout the exhibition period. The show’s tickets are scheduled
      so as to follow COVID-19 physical distancing guidelines and a mask must be
      worn inside the gallery. An interactive 360° virtual tour of the exhibition
      can be found at SoMad.NYC.

      Fogo translates from Portuguese to fire, in reference to the fires ravaging
      the Brazilian rainforest and wetlands. Brazil’s National Space Agency (INPE)
      identified that the number of Rainforest fires in 2020 have surged by 84%.
      The wetlands region alone has seen 50% more destruction than the fires
      currently consuming the North American West. The burning of the most
      biologically diverse habitat on the planet comes as a result of criminal
      exploitative actions led by president Jair Bolsonaro.
      SoMad has united a community of artists and activists, emBracing the power
      of art to affect social change, working to honor Latinx lives and
      territories, and Bringing attention to those fighting for the Earth's
      survival. FOGO! features artists originating from Argentina, Bolivia,
      Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This exhibition
      celeBrates the artists’ heritage and culturally-informed stylistic
      expressions.

      Inspired by the life and work of Brazilian Indigenous activist and leader of
      the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) Sônia Guajajara, the
      diverse group of Latinx artists featured in this show have come together to
      support the protection of the rainforest and wetlands. Guajajara is an
      active spokeswoman for the country’s Indigenous movement and is on the
      frontline of the fight, resisting destruction and death, demanding
      environmental and social justice. SoMad and the artists are proud to invest
      the gallery commissions from this show to benefit APIB, so they may continue
      to protect and preserve crucial natural and social ecosystems in the Amazon.
