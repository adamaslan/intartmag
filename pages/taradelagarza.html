          <h1>Tara De La Garza Interview</h1>
          <p>by Lily Sullivan</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            In this interview with Tara de la Garza, the curator and artist
            discusses her curation of At Stake in Spring Break Art Fair, along
            with her works and inspirations. De La Garza incorporates both
            science and the occult in her curation. Topics covered in this
            interview include her zero waste studio efforts and collective push
            against consumer culture.

            Your sculpture "Basketball Pillar" uses cement, a basketball, and
            plastic. What inspires your use of unique mixed media? How long
            would a sculpture like this take to create?
          </p>

          <p>
            My work pushes back against consumer culture. I endeavor to have a
            zero-waste studio and to create projects that encourage minimizing
            collective consumption. I create problems for myself by collecting
            materials and challenge myself to use them. During the pandemic, our
            studio program became a ghost town. One day an old basketball rolled
            out in front of my door. It stayed, and became part of the fabric.
            The sculptures take anywhere between a few days and a few weeks to
            make, depending on materials. I use pillar formworks for some pieces
            and pack them with Styrofoam, poured cement and hard plastics on the
            periphery for texture and interest. I call this method
            ‘sequestering’ and they essentially become time capsules of
            consumption. They can be interpreted as a simulacra of decay, the
            totemic shapes often returning to a state rendered organic,
            monuments to an era that may become to be known as The Plastocene.

            What motivated your collaboration with artists Joseph Ari Aloi and
            Leslie Lanxinger in At Stake?
          </p>

          <p>
            Joseph Ari Aloi and I first worked together in 2009, during another
            economic downturn caused by the financial crisis. I was working with
            Manon Slome, building “No Longer Empty”, an organization that
            created massive installations in empty storefronts in NYC. Joseph
            was one of the artists we curated into an exhibition at the Chelsea
            Hotel. He spent days laboriously drawing on multiple surfaces using
            his intricate calligraphy style. I was exhibiting defunct neon signs
            ‘collaged’ together and curating a section of the show. We kept in
            touch and, especially through the pandemic, began a visual dialogue,
            collaborating on our version of exquisite corpses and triptychs
            exhibited at Spring/Break LA.
          </p>

            Surviving as humans during climate change will require adapting.
            Humans have evolved through natural selection, constantly going
            through a process of adaptation, destruction and rebuilding as part
            of the human experience. How we coexist with disaster in the future
            will involve enormous amounts of human ingenuity; how do we keep
            flood/fire/famine/war from completely undermining civilization. We
            touch on some of these ideas in the collaboration asking - what is
            at stake and what is salvageable. In this installation Joseph Ari
            Aloi and I worked on and beside each other’s work, riffing in a
            visual jam session to create our joint projects. We engaged in a
            version of the 18th century surrealist parlor game, The Exquisite
            Corpse, Aloi building intricate drawing scaffoldings for the evolved
            creatures that I create with collaged elements borrowed from nature.
            These remind us of the interconnected ecosystem we are a part of.
            The work continues in the form of collaborative triptychs. The
            triptych was a well-established format for religious paintings in
            the Middle Ages. The triptych folds in on itself, becoming mobile.
            Our presentation of this ancient dialogue utilizes frames that are
            scorched using a Japanese preservation technique called Yaki Sugi. A
            future necessity in fire zones, the transportable artworks remind us
            of loss.
