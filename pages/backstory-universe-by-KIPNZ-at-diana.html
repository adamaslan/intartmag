          <p>Figures in tufted felt tumbling out into the gallery. Skulls, side by side, lying in wait for the
            punchline of a joke. Abstracted alphabetical constructions layered, one over the other, in layers
            of color and shadow. In Backstory Universe, the meaning lies in the relative madness of what
            each participating artist brings to the table. Works by Annie Hayes, Paul Latislaw and Rhys
            Ziemba populate the exhibition, bringing to mind vignettes from a daydream or a scene from
            Alice in Wonderland. Visitors to this exhibit at Diana New York at 127 Henry Street, curated by
            KIPNZ gallery’s Kenneth Pietrobono and Natalie Zayne, observe the lack of limitations that
            artists working at the boundary of comprehension can bring to a three-person exhibition.</p>

          <p>Sculptor Paul Latislaw’s “Bar Fight: Scene III” anchors the scene at Diana for Backstory
            Universe, serving as an inflection point in dynamic white felted wool figures engaging in the
            titular bar fight. The work is multi-dimensional and visceral, as guests can almost feel the violent
            motion of the bar patrons grappling in the center of the gallery space. The work itself feels both
            timeless and immediate. The contours of the sculpture entice the viewer to get closer: to learn
            more.</p>

       <p>
        Painter Rhys Ziemba confounds the visitor with his enigmatic paintings, and nowhere is this
        more cutting than in the large scale painting, “The Flight to Varennes.” Evoking the scene of the
        final French monarch, Louis XVI, and his family’s failed escape attempt from the country, the
        tableau of items on hand is evocative and strange in equal measure. Workout equipment is
        barely visible. A folding chair is pressed up against the wall behind a table. Ziemba reminds us
        with this, and all of his images present in Backstory Universe, that things are not what they may
        seem. His manner of communicating in color also holds surprises for the viewer. Three-
        dimensional objects depicted in the paintings evoke shadow and light, where more mysterious
        elements, like a blue rug, hold tight to their secrets.

        Works on paper by Annie Hayes equally inspire. Jumping into the scene next to “Bar Fight:
        Scene III” her framed artworks seem to communicate telepathically with guests to Diana on
        Henry. Symbols are layered and embrace one another’s shapes like Matisse cut-outs. Smudges
        of contrasting colors feel like smears in action painting: these impressions in curvilinear
        repetition seem to document the history of the artwork itself.

      </figure>
       <p>Hayes works feel especially hard to decipher. They are made with colored pencil and pastel or
        ink and pastel on paper, and feel almost like screenshots of augmented reality works. The artist
        manages to capture our cultural moment in miniature, with hidden messages embedded in
        shapes that seem to communicate secret architectural plans and archaeology sites. Seeming to
        be precious and immediate at the same time, these prints form a visceral link to the world of the
        internet, where symbols, logos, graphics and designs populate every website we click on. </p>
