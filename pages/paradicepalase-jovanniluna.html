            Hidden expression marked with strong visual imagery highlight the
            process by which Jovanni Luna creates “paintskins”. While the final
            art object is striking the entire process is filled with fulfilling
            aesthetic moments to which only the artist is privy.

<p>            </p>
            “A paintskin, constructed out of latex paint, is in a constant state
            of transformation from its initial state of liquid to solid. It
            gradually evolves through repetitive actions of layering, cutting
            and rolling the paint. This laborious process of working becomes
            hidden with each additional layer of material, obscuring the actions
            before it, allowing only subtle cues to be seen in the end: hints of
            color, gentle textures, subtle brushstrokes, ” says Luna.

            Luna recently showed work at Paradice Palase where he is an Oasis
            Studio member. Paradice Palase is quickly cementing itself a
            cultural institution on the far eastern boundary of Bushwick and
            Bedstuy, which is demarcated by Brooklyn’s heart of commerce,
            Broadway.
<p>            </p>
            Here is a bit more from Paradice Palase about their platform and
            their show with Jovanni Luna:

<p>            </p>
            “PARADICE PALASE is an arts platform promoting the democratization
            of the art world for creators and patrons. We support emerging
            artists and foster accessible arts patronage by producing
            collectible arts retails, online content, and exhibitions. We
            champion a model funded in part by a public members community, where
            art makers and lovers can subscribe in exchange for benefits.{
            Founded in 2017 by Kat Ryals and Lauren Hirshfield, they connected
            after each recognizing barriers to entry for artists and collectors
            in the contemporary art landscape. Thus PARADICE PALASE is the love
            child of DIY and art world utopia, with a flare of the bold and
            brilliant.
<p>            </p>

            Postponed was a very exciting show to see Jovanni bring to life. As
            one of our Oasis Studios Members, we had the privilege of following
            his progress on the series from its infancy. There is an almost
            obsessive repetition that exists in his practice, and the process to
            create each "paint skin" as he calls them - whether 3 feet tall or
            the size of a finger - manifests as a sort of 3-dimensional mark
            making. Manipulation of latex house paint has been the core of
            Jovanni's practice for nearly 10 years and it was exciting to
            witness yet another innovative body of work with the material reach
            completion on our gallery walls. The closing reception, on July
            17th, was the first in-person reception we hosted since the
            quarantine first began in NYC. We were very grateful to have been
            able to assist in these works getting fresh eyes on them IRL. The
            works beg for intimate encounters; the hundreds of mini spiraled
            forms populate their designated shelves and each structure seemed at
            once both precious and concrete. The choice Jovanni makes to present
            his paint skins within framed shelves triggers thoughts of
            categorical archives, a coded language, macro and micro cityscapes,
            and rhythmic jazz. Perhaps most poignant however is that postponed
            was birthed through a time of crisis, of people feeling trapped in
            their boxes while knowing the precariousness the outside world now
            offers. Other recent sculptures from Jovanni consider the ease in
            which things fall apart if we rush to solve them. The works in
            postponed gave us a chance instead to hold space for them, to move
            with grace and compassion, and be rewarded for it.”
