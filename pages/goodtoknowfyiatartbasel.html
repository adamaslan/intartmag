          <p>
            At an art week megavent known for its over-the-topness, notably
            saturated this year with an appendix of cryptobro and NFT influence,
            the curatorial collective Good To Know.FYI ‘s show PLEASURETOWN
            punched well above its weight on behalf of all who make art no
            matter what.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pop-up show, up until Dec 8th in the historic lobby of the Park
            Manor apartments, brings the best of site-specific curation and
            grass roots energy to Art Basel Miami. The show responds to Miami
            Beach Nightlife, especially “sexual positivity,” “dance culture,”
            “social change,” and “personal liberation”—but with something
            fresh and unexpected during ABM: restraint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Julianna Vezzetti, a co-founder of the collective, illuminates part
            of the ethos of the curation behind Good to Know FYI:
    “We always like to have an artist's work site
            responsive and also provide a white cube space.”
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            The show likely reached peak nightlife vibe during the opening on
            Dec 1. At the curb outside the entrance, Antonia Wright and Helado
            Negro's monstrous Cement Truck marímbula "Not Yet Paved" chirped
            away.. metallic plucks against idling diesel before entranced
            viewers. A real delight for the child in all of us, and a nod to the
            working class Latinx community. The piece showcases the disjointed experience
            immigrants face in the US. “It is the irony that we created this,
            but you are trying to expedite us out,” says Vezzetti. Inside the
            lobby, works hid behind partygoers among the dim lighting in Miami
            fashion, but rewarded those ready with a flashlight (yours truly).
            Tatyana Zambrano's pair of miniature golden twerking figures dazzled
            like pre-Columbian treasures at the center of the room, as did Tim
            Karoleff's futuristic manicured coral nearby. Italian artist
            Nazareno Biondo's whimsical marble sculptures of cigarette butts and
            a rolled up $2 bill felt fittingly strewn around in the space, in
            one case hanging out on the floor next to No Touching Ground's
            sci-fi femme cutouts, illuminated by a sex-textured holographic
            flame.
          </p>

          <p>
            2D works by Andronoos and Jason GVVL anchored the show with
            Miami-ness that celebrate the neon beachfront vibe, and other
            wall-mounted works celebrating queer identity, especially
            historical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brookhart Jonquil's curious gloss black illuminated floor sculpture
            proposed a space-age cross section of strip club facade against a
            large mirror wall, bringing a very masculine energy against Autumn
            Casey’s soft and fleshy lamps. In the opposite corner, a relaxed nod
            to digital art via VR viewing room. The interactive environment
            invited viewers to touchscreen-navigate through a desert palace of
            NFTs for sale, sex toys occasionally rocketing across the VR
            skyscape (not for sale).
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            With such breadth, the show has no sensory overload artworks, nor
            does it pack in a bevy of responses to the curatorial theme. Good To
            Know.fyi’s (ahem) retrained selection of 2D, 3D, 4D and digital
            works felt causally at home in the historic surroundings, repping
            MIAMI BEACH! and PARTY! in distinctly 2021 terms.
