<h1> A Retort to Neitzsche's 'Will to Power' </h1>
What is the will to power? <br><br> What is the will to anything other than a drive or an affect of some type?
<br><br>
Affectivity is that crappily defined as moodiness.
<br><br>
Is moodiness that leads one to greatness really all we need?
<br><br>
Maybe all we need is like half a brain, some resources, and a type of moodiness that makes things happen?
<br><br>
Then, it goes that will to power as a motivated moodiness is the main drive to be concerned with in terms of being a highly functional human. <br> <br> However, doesn't a state of high functionality occur when one combination of productive moods overcome our more basic moods that may just be concerned with food, water, sex, etc? <br><br>Then, isn't it the case that these other smaller drives are really where the battle is fought, <br> making the war just a history of these smaller drives battling each other in endless repetition without ever really seeing the will to power being expressed in a singular form?
<br><br>
