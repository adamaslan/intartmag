 <br><br> ----------------------------------------------------------------- <br><br> New Gallery in BK: Jorge Andrew Gallery<br><br>
 by Adam Aslan_. 2–?-2017 <br><br>

Southeast Williamsburg has a new gallery. Jorge Andrew Gallery is about to wrap up its first show and prepares to exhibit Emma Stern this coming Friday April 7th from 6 - 9 pm.  <br><br>Here are some words on the artist from the gallery's first show from curator, Jorge Day: <br><br>Alex Markwith is an artist currently working in New York City. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) with a BFA in Painting in 2011. He has had solo shows at Nicelle Beauchene Gallery (New York), Hiram Butler Gallery (Houston) and has recently been part of the Bone Yard Project at the PIMA Air & Space Museum (Tucson, AZ). <br><br>

Equally at home in the more stoic well-worn settings of the white cube, and also non-traditional spaces such as his recent solo exhibition at diy pop-up space Jorge Andrew Gallery. Alex Markwith’s Art is a dichotomy, an assault of visceral materialism and thoughtful assemblage giving the viewer a hint of political subversion without being excessively didactic. Themes of submission and domination are underpinned not by the conversation, but by the juxtaposition of material throughout his work. The pairing of faux fur and roofing tile, tar and stretched fabric. In some cases Markwith blurs the lines of fashion, exhibition, and fine art. In one case recreating a classic leather motorcycle jacket wrapped around a canvas and re-stitched to accentuate it’s new inhuman form. Watch the interview below to hear Markwith’s take on his process and the importance of alternative exhibition spaces.
