     Tips for Tequila Drinking at Bossa Nova Civic Club
</p>
<p align="center">
    By Adam Aslan
</p>
<p>
    If you are one of those people that finds themselves in Brookyln and
    wanting to dance or chill in an authentic sort of gothy way, there are few
    options. A solid choice for tasty tequila and techno is Bossa Nova Civic
    Club. There are certain ways to go out to Bossa Nova Civic Club or as the
    Bushwick locals call it, &#8220;Bossa.&#8221; You can really go for it,
    kind of go for it, or even just not go for it at all. What is that you say?
    Why even talk about not going for it all? Where&#8217;s the fun in that?
    Well, because I just wanted to give an accurate range of options available
    in terms of &#8220;going in&#8221; at Bossa. Maybe I am going in too much
    on the mean, median, mode, range tip.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe I am overall too much of a math and computer nerd, but I think its
    important to note that Bossa offers delicious free ice water mixed with
    your choice of cucumber or lemon. Few venues offer such quality no cost
    options to hydrate. Also important to note, is that they have comfy
    circular booths to just kick back with some friends to some pretty loud but
    not ear piercing music.
</p>
<p>
    Now comes the more fun part. Going in a bit more as they say. If you are
    trying to go in, then a best value way to start the evening would be with
    the bartender&#8217;s tequila of choice, Espolon Blanco. At 7 dollars a
    shot you get the 2012 silver place winner of the International Wine and
    Spirit Competition. Espolon is made of 100% blue agave or as they call it
    in its homeland in the highlands of Jalisco, &#8220;agave azul&#8221; or
    &#8220;agave tequilana&#8221;. What emerges from this agave is a nose with
    a hint of sweetness reminiscent of Mexico&#8217;s many fruit trees mixed
    with a piney agave profile. It does have a bit of spicy finish to it, but
    it definitely doesn&#8217;t have the death bite or nauseating after taste
    of a cheap well &#8220;tequila&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
    While Bossa does have many different levels of going in, a sure fire way to
    get you up a level is with solid tequila like Espolon. If you&#8217;re
    feeling generous, you could even buy the bartender a shot. I&#8217;m pretty
    sure their boss-a won&#8217;t mind!
