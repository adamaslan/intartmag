    Much was done to clamour for the rights of BIPOC over the summer and steps
    have been made by some art institutions to be more inclusive, but still
    “FOGO!” an exhibition featuring Latinx artists in support of APIB
    (Brazilian's Indigenous People Articulation) stands out amongst the rest.
    The show is powerful and pays beautiful homage to an indigenous aesthetic
    that is simultaneously historically rich and contemporary.<br /><br /><img

    Anytime a group show features 19 artists, one may be a bit scared as to the
    amplified variety of aesthetics and varying quality of the art, but SoMad
    did an impeccable job of curation, which makes the viewing experience both
    pleasant and inspiring.

    Here is more from the press release:<br /><br />
    "SoMad is thrilled to present FOGO!. The exhibition will take place in the
    physical space of the gallery open to the public from October 12th to
    November 12th, 2020. Tickets can be obtained on Eventbrite for the
    physically distanced Opening Reception on Indigenous People’s Day (formally
    known as Columbus Day,) October 12, 2020, from 3:00–9:00pm and also for
    viewing throughout the exhibition period. The show’s tickets are scheduled
    so as to follow COVID-19 physical distancing guidelines and a mask must be
    worn inside the gallery. An interactive 360° virtual tour of the exhibition
    can be found at SoMad.NYC. <br /><br />

    Fogo translates from Portuguese to fire, in reference to the fires ravaging
    the Brazilian rainforest and wetlands. Brazil’s National Space Agency (INPE)
    identified that the number of Rainforest fires in 2020 have surged by 84%.
    The wetlands region alone has seen 50% more destruction than the fires
    currently consuming the North American West. The burning of the most
    biologically diverse habitat on the planet comes as a result of criminal
    exploitative actions led by president Jair Bolsonaro.<br /><br />
    SoMad has united a community of artists and activists, embracing the power
    of art to affect social change, working to honor Latinx lives and
    territories, and bringing attention to those fighting for the Earth's
    survival. FOGO! features artists originating from Argentina, Bolivia,
    Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This exhibition
    celebrates the artists’ heritage and culturally-informed stylistic
    expressions.<br /><br />
    Inspired by the life and work of Brazilian Indigenous activist and leader of
    the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) Sônia Guajajara, the
    diverse group of Latinx artists featured in this show have come together to
    support the protection of the rainforest and wetlands. Guajajara is an
    active spokeswoman for the country’s Indigenous movement and is on the
    frontline of the fight, resisting destruction and death, demanding
    environmental and social justice. SoMad and the artists are proud to invest
    the gallery commissions from this show to benefit APIB, so they may continue
    to protect and preserve crucial natural and social ecosystems in the Amazon.
