<u>The Awkward Quest for a Funky Natural Red Wine <br> By Adam Aslan 6-30-18</u>
<br>
An awkward question is posed, “hey...there...Im looking for a ...natural wine...something funky...that isn’t going to cost over twenty five dollars?”
<br><br>
If you are like me, then your normal speaking voice is ridden with pauses so as to humbly point out a lack of certainty. When it comes to the new movement of natural wines, one could say the whole movement should be speaking in such a tone. A movement that is clearly going to gain steam in 2018, natural wines do not come with a certification one has to pay for necessarily specific like a wine that is certified organic or biodynamic for example and thus, the definition of natural is open to interpretation.<br><br>
While the question of what makes a wine natural is clearly an interesting one, another great question is: why is everybody freaking out over natural wines? There are several good answers to that question. You could answer that question by mentioning all the nods to minimilism that comes with natural wine like the lack of or minimal use of sulfites, lack of advanced technology, or lack of filtration. Another way you could answer that question would be to mention how natural wine uses more old school techniques in the wine making process. Lets not forget all the cool labels they come with, botique distrubuters, stores, and restraurants all dedicated to natural wine. However, none of these are the best reason to freak out about natural wine. <br><br>
